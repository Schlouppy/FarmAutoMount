## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install the addon** via CurseForge or manually
2. **Go gather something** - the addon works out of the box!
3. *(Optional)* Set a specific mount with `/fam mount <name>`

### Default Behavior

- Uses your **favorite mount** if no mount is configured
- **0.5 second delay** before mounting (avoids mounting during looting animation)
- Error notifications **enabled** by default

---

## 🔧 Examples

```
/fam mount Swift Spectral Tiger
→ Sets "Swift Spectral Tiger" for this character

/fam account Reins of the Grand Expedition Yak
→ Sets the yak for all your characters

/fam delay 1
→ Waits 1 second before mounting

/fam reset
→ This character now uses the account mount (or favorite)
```

## ❓ FAQ

### Why doesn't it work for my Druid?
Druids are automatically skipped! Travel Form is instant and better than any mount. The addon assumes you're using it.

### The addon mounted while I was still looting!
Increase the delay: `/fam delay 1` (or more)

### I don't want error messages in chat
Toggle them off: `/fam silent`

### How do I see what's happening?
Enable debug mode: `/fam debug`

### Does it work with [Mount Addon X]?
Yes! Farm Auto Mount just calls `C_MountJournal.SummonByID()`. It's compatible with any mount manager.
