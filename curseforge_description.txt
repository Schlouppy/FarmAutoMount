Full description:

Farm Auto Mount automatically resummons your mount right after gathering any resource — herbs, ore, or lumber. No more fumbling with keybinds between each node.

- Configurable delay between harvest and mount summon
- Settings persist between sessions
- 10 languages supported (EN, FR, DE, ES, IT, PT, RU, KO, ZH-CN, ZH-TW)
